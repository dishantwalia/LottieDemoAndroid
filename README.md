# LottieDemoAndroid
Lottie is a mobile library created by Airbnb for Android and iOS that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as json with Bodymovin and renders them natively on mobile!
 We can easily render animations without the need of writing lines and lines of code. It is really cool and saves you tons of time from implementing the animations.
 In this Demo, I have demonstrated lottie supoorted animation with additional image assets in Android :
 Need BodyMovie or Adobe after effects transit json file that consist mapping of animation
 Open source json file taken from : https://www.lottiefiles.com/
